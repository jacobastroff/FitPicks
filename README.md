# FitPicks

This project is available and ready to be used at fit-picks.netlify.app

## About FitPicks

FitPicks is an app that allows user to search and query for various workouts based on name, type of exercise, muscles targeted and the difficulty of the exercise. Users can view descriptions and intructions for each workout and save their workouts to local storage.

## Why I chose to make FitPicks

I chose to create this application because I know that many people out there (myself included when I first got started) would love to start working out but find it very difficult to start. After all, some of the machines in the gym aren't so intuitive and many of them are prone to cause injury if the person working out doesn't know what they are doing. My application provides the user with the knowledge necessary to get started.

## What I used to make this application

I created this application from scratch using HTML, CSS, and React.js (app bundled and packaged by create-react-app). The API I used to get the workout data corresponding to user input is the [Ninja's Exercise API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/exercises)

## What I learned

Although the React knowledge part of the development was mostly review from my React Developer course, I learned how to build an application from scratch, and how to code in react on my own without the aid of an instructor. As well, I learned a ton about utilizing ChatGPT (DALL-E) to create consistent and accurate images for each type of workout. I learned and practiced the usage of Gen-IDs to improve my prompts to the AI system. (The logo was also created by ChatGPT, and this was done through learning, finding and testing different custom GPTs)
